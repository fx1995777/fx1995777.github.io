I am Xiao Feng, currently working in the communication department of a local government in Zhejiang, China. I completed my MA in Media Arts and Cultures at Communication University of China, advised by Prof. Kewu Pan. Previously, I received my BA in English at Zhejiang A&F University, supervised by Prof. Jieying Luo.

My academic interests lie at the intersection of Political Communication, AI Governance, and Public Engagement, with a special focus on the social and psychological effects of Human-AI interaction. Particularly, I am intrigued to investigate how interactive technology affects users’ perceptions and emotions and behaviors in civic and political life. 

These interests are profoundly shaped by my work and research experiences. I’ve been involved in projects such as Online Public Opinion and Social Media Analysis and served as the lead for Online Legal Publicity and Education. These experiences not only developed my skills in coordination and critical media analysis, but also gave me firsthand insight into how digital communication mediates state-society relationships. 

Earlier in my graduate studies, I contributed to several national and provincial -level projects in theater, film and TV, again under Prof. Kewu Pan’s guidance. My MA thesis Narrative Mode and Aesthetic Value of Time-loop Moving Images was recognized as one of the program’s most valuable research contributions. It explored how time-loop moving images as an integrated media form affect audience cognition, emotion, and reflection.

Outside of academia and work, I enjoy writing novels and spending time with my sweetie cat, zhuzhu, a family member and quiet companion who reminds me daily to stay curious and patient.
